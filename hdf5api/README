CARP HDF5 API
=============

This is a library of functions that wraps HDF5 API calls to interface with
HDF5 files used by CARP and Meshalyzer.


Usage
-----

Build and test the project like so:

    make
    make test

Note that tests are structured in such a way that write operations are tested
by writing data with this API then verified by using HDF library functions.  
However, read functions are provided data fixtures that are built with the
API's own write functions.  As such, there are dependencies in the read tests
on the validity of the data generated by the write functions.  The upside is
that fixtures are much simpler to write and maintain.  The downside is the
brittleness of the read tests with respect to their dependencies on the write
functions.

Install the project (after building) like this:

    make install

To install to a prefix other than /usr/local use the following:

    make install -e prefix=/your/desired/prefix



Dependencies
------------

Clearly, the HDF5 library is a dependency and it can be obtained from:

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

Building and installing is straightforward with the exception of the install
step which requires that a prefix be given (otherwise it installs into the
source directory):

    (in the hdf5 directory after unarchiving)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx
    make
    make check
    make install
    make check-install

Compiling with make uses the HDF compiler helper h5cc which simply identifies
the location of the HDF5 libraries and headers and sets a few compile flags.
If you experience problems with this, it is trivial to compile otherwise by
simply specifying the library and header locations to your compiler.
